# CSS Specificity

Codecademy's second full-stack engineer career path challenge project!

The prompt was to create a simple webpage cheatsheet, using HTML and CSS, that explained any HTML or CSS concept that had been covered up until that point in the course.

The topic I chose was CSS selector specificity.

Within the filesystem you will find two files:

- HTML file - index.html
- CSS file - index.css
